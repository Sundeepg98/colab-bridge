## 🔐 Security Comparison

### **❌ Embedded Credentials (Less Secure)**
```python
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON = '''{"private_key": "..."}'''
# Visible to everyone with notebook access!
```

### **✅ Colab Secrets (More Secure)**
```python
from google.colab import userdata
sa_json = userdata.get('sun_colab')
# Credentials never exposed in code!
```
